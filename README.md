# Zola Blog Example

Example blog set up using [Zola](http://getzola.org/).

## One Click Deploy

Can't be bothered to set it up?

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/li-kai/example-zola)

## Requirements

This website is built with zola, so if you want to make changes to the templates or structures of the site, please first read about [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/). But if you are just going to modify the data or update/add a post, you can simply follow the guide below.

## Getting started

Enter this folder and run

```bash
./zola.sh serve
```

Zola will now generate the site and watch the directory and update the site when any changes are made. You can access the site at `http://localhost:1111`.

## Deployment

This example deploys using Netlify. Once set up, git pushes to the master branch will immediately update the blog to the latest version.
